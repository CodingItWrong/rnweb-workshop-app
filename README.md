# RN Web Workshop App

The repository used in the ["Building for Web and Mobile with Expo"](https://codingitwrong.com/workshops/rnweb/) workshop at React Advanced 2022.

This branch is the starting state of the workshop. It includes a basic Expo app with linting and autoformatting added.

## Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) 16.x (newer may not work)
- [Yarn 1.x](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- At least one of the following ways to run a React Native app:
  - A physical Android or iOS device
  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) for the Android Emulator
  - [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for the iOS Simulator
- A code editor configured for React development

## Installation

Clone the repo locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingItWrong/rnweb-workshop-app.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
$ cd rnweb-workshop-app
$ yarn install
```

## Running

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Next, open the app on a physical phone, Android Emulator, or iOS Simulator. For instructions, see [Opening the app on your phone/tablet - Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/create-a-new-app/#opening-the-app-on-your-phonetablet)

You should see the app launch on the device and the message "Open up App.js to start working on your app!" displayed.

If you reached this point and everything is working, congratulations: you are ready for the workshop!
